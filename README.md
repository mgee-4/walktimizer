# walktimizer
A silly project to help people optimize the speed at which they walk at!

Components Used:
- BN-220 GPS Module
- Arduino Nano 33 BLE
- I2C OLED Display

Implemented:
- Speed tracker with a GPS module
- Speed efficiency tracking compared to a hard coded test value
- Information printing to a display

To Implement:
- A state machine to allow switching between display mode and user paramter update mode
- A mathematical model to calculate an ideal speed based on user parameters
